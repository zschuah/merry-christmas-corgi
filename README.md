# Welcome to Merry Christmas Corgi

This project uses [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) directly from a CDN.

## Tech Stack

Vue, Bootstrap

### Info

This was a simple site that I created, testing out the Unsplash API to fetch images of random Corgis. Every time the image flips to the Christmas tree, it will post a GET request to the API to fetch another Corgi image.
